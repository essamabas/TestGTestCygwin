Usage: gcovr [options]

A utility to run gcov and generate a simple report that summarizes the
coverage

Options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --version             Print the version number, then exit
  -v, --verbose         Print progress messages
  --object-directory=OBJDIR
                        Specify the directory that contains the gcov data
                        files.  gcovr must be able to identify the path
                        between the *.gcda files and the directory where gcc
                        was originally run.  Normally, gcovr can guess
                        correctly.  This option overrides gcovr's normal path
                        detection and can specify either the path from gcc to
                        the gcda file (i.e. what was passed to gcc's '-o'
                        option), or the path from the gcda file to gcc's
                        original working directory.
  -o OUTPUT, --output=OUTPUT
                        Print output to this filename
  -k, --keep            Keep the temporary *.gcov files generated by gcov.  By
                        default, these are deleted.
  -d, --delete          Delete the coverage files after they are processed.
                        These are generated by the users's program, and by
                        default gcovr does not remove these files.
  -f FILTER, --filter=FILTER
                        Keep only the data files that match this regular
                        expression
  -e EXCLUDE, --exclude=EXCLUDE
                        Exclude data files that match this regular expression
  --gcov-filter=GCOV_FILTER
                        Keep only gcov data files that match this regular
                        expression
  --gcov-exclude=GCOV_EXCLUDE
                        Exclude gcov data files that match this regular
                        expression
  -r ROOT, --root=ROOT  Defines the root directory for source files.  This is
                        also used to filter the files, and to standardize the
                        output.
  -x, --xml             Generate XML instead of the normal tabular output.
  --xml-pretty          Generate pretty XML instead of the normal dense
                        format.
  --html                Generate HTML instead of the normal tabular output.
  --html-details        Generate HTML output for source file coverage.
  --html-absolute-paths
                        Set the paths in the HTML report to be absolute
                        instead of relative
  -b, --branches        Tabulate the branch coverage instead of the line
                        coverage.
  -u, --sort-uncovered  Sort entries by increasing number of uncovered lines.
  -p, --sort-percentage
                        Sort entries by decreasing percentage of covered
                        lines.
  --gcov-executable=GCOV_CMD
                        Defines the name/path to the gcov executable [defaults
                        to the GCOV environment variable, if present; else
                        'gcov'].
  --exclude-unreachable-branches
                        Exclude from coverage branches which are marked to be
                        excluded by LCOV/GCOV markers or are determined to be
                        from lines containing only compiler-generated "dead"
                        code.
  -g, --use-gcov-files  Use preprocessed gcov files for analysis.
  -s, --print-summary   Prints a small report to stdout with line & branch
                        percentage coverage
